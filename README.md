HTML
The HTML code creates a container div with a circle div inside it. The circle div has a shape div inside it.
The shape div is initially a circle, but can be changed to a triangle by clicking the "change shape" button.


CSS
The CSS code styles the container div, the circle div, and the shape div. The container div is centered on the page and has a width and height of 500px. 
The circle div is positioned absolutely inside the container div and has a width and height of 200px. The shape div is positioned absolutely
inside the circle div and has a width and height of 100px.

JavaScript
The JavaScript code adds event listeners to the "change color" and "change shape" buttons. 
The "change color" button changes the background color of the circle div to a random color from the Color array. 
The "change shape" button changes the shape of the shape div from a circle to a triangle and vice versa.
